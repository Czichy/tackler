= Performance results

These are ballpark results.
They are mostly used to validate sanity of used algorithms and overall performance.

Typically there are five runs, and slowest and fastest are dropped off from results.
Then Average is calculated based on remaining three.

Results with versions correspond to different ANTLR versions, and
most current version is without version string.

Current result is located here: link:./hw01/perf-1E6.txt[]
