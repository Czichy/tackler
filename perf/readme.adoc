= Tackler performance test setup

This directory contains tools and reference results for Tackler's performance testing.

Tools and results are in link:./bin[bin] and link:./results[results] directories.
Test data is generated by link:../tools/generator[generator] tool.

With bigger datasets it is good idea to put this whole perf directory outside 
of Tackler project directory.  If 1E5-1E6 datasets are inside project's directory, 
your IDE might go nuts while it scans new files.
