= Identity report

Identity report produces an export of transactions as they are interpreted by Tackler.

This report is valid input for Tackler, so it can be used for example archiving purposes.

Input order of Txn can not be mandated. So there should be a stable way to sort transactions if
internal order of identity report (e.g. order of txns during one day and without time information)
is important.  In that case it is mandatory to provide  unique sorting information for each transaction.

Txn components are used in following order to find sort order
(in case of previous components have produced "same" sort order):

 timestamp, code, description, uuid

If fully deterministic and safe "distributed txn source"-proof sort
order is needed, then transactions must have UUIDs.
